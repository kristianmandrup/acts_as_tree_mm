= mongo_mapper-acts_as_tree

This is an implementation of a tree structure for MongoMapper. 

== Installation

Install as gem

  gem install ramdiv-mongo_mapper_acts_as_tree
  
== Usage

Enable the tree functionality by declaring acts_as_tree on your model

  class Category
    include MongoMapper::Document
    include MongoMapper::Acts::Tree
  
    key :name, String
  
    acts_as_tree
  end

The method accepts :parent_id_field, :path_field, :depth_field, :order, :search_class as a hash.

  :parent_id_field, :path_field, :depth_field => override the default field names
  :order => control the order (format "_field-name_ _[asc|desc]_")
  :search_class => expects a Class that is a MongoMapper::Document to be used for search

Check test_tree.rb and test_search_class.rb for examples.

== About bugs

Use it. If you find any bugs, contact me (if possible with a test case) or patch it yourself (see next section).

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
